                    Our lead generation process works as follows:
                    <ol>
                        <li>We search the internet for your query.</li>
                        <li>Our AI looks through the results.</li>
                        <li>Each result is classified as either a lead or a lead source.</li>
                        <li>Both leads and sources are presented to you.</li>
                        <li>Sources are searched again to find additional leads.</li>
                        <li>Leads are scanned for contact information, descriptions and quality.</li>
                        <li>Finally, you can like or hide leads to improve future results.</li>
                    </ol>
                    This comprehensive approach ensures you get high-quality leads relevant to your query.

                    The Lead Quality Prediction model is a machine learning algorithm that helps you identify <b>high-quality leads</b>. Here's how it works:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Like and hide at least 50 leads (100 total).</li>
                        <li>Train your model.</li>
                        <li>The model trains on your preferences based on your liked and hidden leads.</li>
                        <li>After training, it scores each of your leads with a probability of being a good lead.</li>
                        <li>This helps you focus on the most promising leads, saving you time and effort.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Each new lead you scan will be automatically scored by the model, helping you make better decisions. You can also retrain this model at any time with updated data to improve its accuracy.

                        <li>You can switch to gpt-4o-mini in the settings menu to reduce costs significantly with slightly lower accuracy.</li>
