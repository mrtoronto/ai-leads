                    Our lead generation process works as follows:
                    <ol>
                        <li>We search the internet for your query.</li>
                        <li>Our AI looks through the results.</li>
                        <li>Each result is classified as either a lead or a lead source.</li>
                        <li>Both leads and sources are presented to you.</li>
                        <li>Sources are searched again to find additional leads.</li>
                        <li>Leads are checked for contact information, descriptions and quality.</li>
                        <li>Finally, you can like or hide leads to refine the quality scores and train your model further.</li>
                    </ol>
                    This comprehensive approach ensures you get high-quality leads relevant to your query.

                    The Lead Quality Prediction model is a machine learning algorithm that helps you identify <b>high-quality leads</b>. Here's how it works:
                    <ul>
                        <li>You like at least 50 leads and hide at least 50 leads.</li>
                        <li>Once you meet this criteria, you can train a model.</li>
                        <li>The model learns from your preferences based on your liked and hidden leads.</li>
                        <li>After training, it scores each of your leads with a probability of being a good lead.</li>
                        <li>This helps you focus on the most promising leads, saving you time and effort.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Each new lead you check will be automatically scored by the model, helping you make better decisions. You can also retrain this model at any time with updated data to improve its accuracy.

                    We use a credit-based pricing system:
                    <ul>
                        <li>You can purchase credits in packages of 10,000, 25,000, 50,000, or 100,000.</li>
                        <li>Most actions cost around 100 credits, but this can vary based on the length and number of results.</li>
                        <li>You can switch to gpt-4o-mini in the settings menu to reduce costs by 10x, with slightly lower accuracy.</li>
                        <li>Credits are deducted as you use the service, allowing you to pay only for what you use.</li>
